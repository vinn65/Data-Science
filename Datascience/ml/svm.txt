SVM - support vector machine - supervised, classification as well as regression problems.

however classification is its common use.

creates a best line or decision boundary that can generate  n-dimensional space into classes that can be used to put new data items in their correct category. Best line is hyperlane.

Types

1. Linear svm - linearly seperable data.
Non-linear svm - data that cannot be classified using a straight line

Hyperlane - there can be multiple lines but we need to find the best decision boundary.

support vector - the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and which affect the position of the hyperplane. 

Margin - distance between vectors and hyperplane.
