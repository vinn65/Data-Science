decision tree - supervised, both classification and regression.

but mostly classification problems

Two nodes, decision and leaf node.

decision are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, 
Leaf are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.

Cart algo is used to build a decision tree. classification and regression tree algorithm.

Why use DT
- Mimic human thinking ability while making decisions, It`s logic can easily be understood because it shows a tree-like structure.

 Pruning - removing unwanted branceds from the tree.
 Disadvantages - comples - may have lots of layers
 - have overfitting issues - resolved using Random forest algorithm
 - Computational complexity may increase for more class labels.
